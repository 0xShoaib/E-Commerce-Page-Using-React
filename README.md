# Shoplane - A Place For Shoppong

This is the same website that I have created using JavaScript before ( *[check the repository here](https://github.com/shoaib-03/E-Commerce-Project)* ), but after learning the basics of React, I have converted the Javascript based website into a React based website.

This is an E-Commerce webbsite that I have created when i have learned the basis of React. The purpose of this project is to get a good understanding in basics of React.

I have learned how to fetches data from an API. I have used **axios** to make the network call. And also learned how to handle state management in React, Working with Props, and much more...
